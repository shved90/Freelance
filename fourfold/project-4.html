			Increase Coca-Cola sales across the country.

			<h1>Solution</h1>
			<hr>
			A promotion with a difference – no one knew what they were going to win, but, they knew it was going to be big! All consumers had to do was buy, submit and wait. The campaign was completely integrated – social, online, event, radio, PR and TV.
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<hr>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Over 1 million cans were purchased across a 6 week period – directly attributed to the promotion. Although sales decreased after the promotion period, they remained a lot higher than the original level with people re-discovering Coke again.</p>
