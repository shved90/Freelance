		Increase the use of Visa cards by at least 36% in the lead up to the 2010 World Cup.

		<h1>Solution
</h1>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">We ran a World Cup-inspired sales promotion in every key shopping centre across the country. All people had to do was use their Visa card in any one of the retailers inside the complex and then bring their receipt to one our Visa World Cup manned hotspots for the chance to win instant football-themed prizes, and, to be automatically entered in to our major prize draw giving people the chance to win tickets to the World Cup final in Johannesburg, South Africa. To drive awareness of the promotion, we ran OOH Media inside each centre directing people to where the Visa hotspots were, and, ran regular games of human-size table football to get people engaged and excited.</p>
</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<hr>
		We increased usage by 66% - nearly double what the sales target had been set at. We also managed to capture over 25,000 pieces of valuable data on our (Visa’s) customers, meaning we could re-target them by location with relevant promotions and offers at a later point with an email marketing campaign with ran post the World Cup.
